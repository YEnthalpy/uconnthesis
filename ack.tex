\noindent {\bf abstract (required)}

The required abstract and a copy of your title page is sent to UMI for
publication in Dissertation Abstracts International.  The abstract must be
in English, double-spaced, must not exceed 350 words, and must be signed by
your adviser.  (Abstracts exceeding 350 words will be returned by UMI.  The
title is not included in the word count.) The dissertation title on the
abstract must be identical to the title on the dissertation title page.


\noindent {\bf abstract within dissertation (optional)}

Your department may require an abstract to be part of the dissertation.  If
so, it is in addition to the initial abstract mentioned above.  Please follow your
department's style requirements, and number all of these pages as part of
the preliminary material (use lower case Roman numerals).  This abstract
must appear in the table of contents and should be included after the initial pages.
